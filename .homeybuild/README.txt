Step into your ideal shower with a single tap or voice command. This app connects your KOHLER DTV+ digital shower system to Homey, giving you control over thermostatic valves, individual outlets, steam, and audio without reaching for the wall controller.

Set up Homey flows to start your favourite shower preset when your morning alarm goes off, turn on the steam generator before you step in, or automatically stop the water after a set time. Each valve, outlet, steamer, and amplifier appears as a separate device in Homey, so you can mix and match them in any automation you can imagine.
